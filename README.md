# Society Management System

### Bakcground Story
It is the year 3142. Robots have finally overtaken the world, and their society involves a very strict hierarchy where every robot knows their place in society. (Also, it should be noted that humans had obviously re-located to Mars by this time, so the planet which the robots have overtaken is Mars, not Earth.) 

Every robot in the Martian Robot Society is considered a citizen of Mars. The nodes in our tree will each represent one citizen. Citizens all have subordinate-superior relationships, where one citizen may work under another. Additionally, some citizens are leaders of a specific district within the society. All citizens that work under a leader are considered part of that district.
